## Halo Takehome

### Description

Halo Takehome is part of the interview process of Halo.
It's a small and fake project for you to show your skills.
By defult the project comes with a simple header and nothing else.

### Running the project

Fork this github repository and make the new repo private.

- Clone your repo
- Install the dependencies running `npm i`.
- Run the backend server with the example movie endpoints running `npm run server`.
- Run the angular application by running `npm run start`.

### Tasks

- Create a card component to show movies. You can use the example image as a reference (there is no need to make it pixel perfect since there are no specs -pixels, sizes, fonts, etc.-, but it would be nice to make it as similar as possible).
- Get data from the server and use it to display movies (GET localhost:3000/movies)
- Nice to have (but not mandatory): Paginate the results using an [infinite scroll](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/infinite_scroll) (the server works with the pagination in the following way: GET localhost:3000/movies?_page=2&_limit=10).

#### Example image reference
